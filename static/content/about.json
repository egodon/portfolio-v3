  "paragraph_1": "My name's Evan. I'm a front-end web developer from Montreal with a passion for building user-interfaces. I see myself as a life-long student with a high interest in learning the latest web technologies.",
  "paragraph_2": "I mostly work on the front-end but I enjoy working on all sides of the stack, from backend APIs to more DevOps related tasks. I also value slick user-interfaces and like to dabble in web design and css animations.",
  "paragraph_3": "I specialize in React and enjoy using the NextJs framework with TypeScript. Whenever I need a backend I reach for Node and use Firebase for backend services. I'm trying to expand on my backend skills and I'm currently learning Python alongside the Django framework."
