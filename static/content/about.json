  "paragraph_1": "I'm a front-end web developer from Montreal who loves buiding user-interfaces. I see myself as a life-long student with a high interest in learning the latest web technologies.",
  "paragraph_2": "I mostly work on the front-end but I enjoy working on all sides of the stack, from backend APIs to more DevOps related tasks. In addition, I like to get creative by dabbling in web design and css animations. ",
  "paragraph_3": "I specialize in React and I enjoy using the NextJs framework with TypeScript. Whenever I need a backend I reach for Node and use Firebase as a database. I'm trying to expand on my backend skills and I'm currently learning Python alongside the Django framework."
